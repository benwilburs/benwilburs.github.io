      <h2>What is Classical Chinese?</h2>
      <p>
	<span class="dropcap">C</span>lassical Chinese (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>文<rb>言
		<rp>(<rt>wén<rt>yán<rp>)</ruby></span>, literally 'refined speech'), narrowly defined, can be considered the language as used in writing between the time of Confucius (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>孔<rb>子<rp>(<rt>kǒng<rt>zǐ<rp>)</ruby></span>), 551–479 B.C.E., during the Spring and Autumn period (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>春<rb>秋<rb>時<rb>代<rp>(<rt>Chūn<rt>Qiū<rt>Shí<rt>dài<rp>)</ruby></span>), through the Warring States period (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>戰<rb>國<rb>時<rb>代<rp>(<rt>Zhàn<rt>guó<rt>Shí<rt>daì<rp>)</ruby></span>), until the unification of China under the Qin dynasty (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>秦<rb>朝<rp>(<rt>Qín<rt>cháo<rp>)</ruby></span>) in 221 B.C.E. This was an era in which Chinese literature flourished and many of the classics were first composed.
      </p>

      <p>
	The earliest parts of the oldest classics, namely the <em>Classic of Changes</em> (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>易<rb>經<rp>(<rt>Yì<rt>jīng<rp>)</ruby></span>), <em>Classic of Documents</em> (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>書<rb>經<rp>(<rt>Shū<rt>jīng<rp>)</ruby></span>), and <em>Classic of Poetry</em> (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>詩<rb>經<rp>(<rt>Shī<rt>jīng<rp>)</ruby></span>), were written during the early Zhou dynasty (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>周<rb>朝<rp>(<rt>Zhōu<rt>cháo<rp>)</ruby></span>), circa the 8<sup>th</sup> and7<sup>th</sup> centuries B.C.E., and contain archaic features not found in the later classical texts. This stage is referred to as Pre-Classical Chinese. Even older are the ancient inscriptions found on the oracle bones and ceremonial bronzes dating from the Shang (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>商<rb>朝<rp>(<rt>Shāng<rt>cháo<rp>)</ruby></span>) and Zhou dynasties.
      </p>

      <p>
	After the unification under Qin, and throughout the following Han dynasty (<span lang="zh"><ruby><rb>漢<rb>朝<rp>(<rt>Hàn<rt>cháo<rp>)</ruby></span>), this language became more standardized under the centralized state, and more fossilized, as writers imitated the language of the Confucian classics, even as the spoken language continued to change. By the end of the Han dynasty, the language had largely become learned rather than spoken, and the written form of Chinese changed little over the next 1500 years, until Classical Chinese began to be replaced with Written Vernacular Chinese in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. This later use of Classical Chinese as a learned language is sometimes distinguished as <em>Literary Chinese</em>, although at other times either Literary or Classical may be used to refer to writing from all periods. 
      </p>

      <p>
	Thus, Classical Chinese is the language of the classics, narrowly defined, and broadly defined it is Literary Chinese, the language of nearly all of the great wealth of literature produced by China until around a century ago, and also much of the literature produced by China's neighbours in the same period. Knowledge of the classical language is essential for anybody wishing to delve deeply into Chinese and East Asian history, literature, culture, and philosophy.
