      <h2>What is Classical Japanese?</h2>
      <p>
	<span class="dropcap">C</span>lassical Japanese (<span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>文<rb>語
		<rp>(<rt>ぶん<rt>ご<rp>)</ruby></span>, literally ‘refined language’) was the literary language of Japan for over a thousand years. It is largely based on the language of the mid-Heian period (<span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>平<rb>安<rb>時<rb>代<rp>(<rt>へい<rt>あん<rt>じ<rt>だい<rp>)</ruby></span>), the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> centuries C.E., when spoken Japanese was in the stage known as Early Middle Japanese. Beginning with the following Kamakura period (<span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>鎌<rb>倉<rb>時<rb>代<rp>(<rt>かま<rt>くら<rt>じ<rt>だい<rp>)</ruby></span>) and over the following centuries, this Heian language remained the model that writers tried to imitate, even as the spoken language continued to evolve. Classical Japanese remained in use as a formal written language well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with it being used in official documents in particular until the end of the Second World War in 1945.
      </p>

      <p>
	The earlier written language of the Nara period (<span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>奈<rb>良<rb>時<rb>代<rp>(<rt>な<rt>ら<rt>じ<rt>だい<rp>)</ruby></span>), being derived from Old Japanese and found in early texts such as the <em>Man'yōshū</em> (<span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>万<rb>葉<rb>集<rp>(<rt>まん<rt>よう<rt>しゅう<rp>)</ruby></span>), displays some marked differences from the later language of the Heian period.

	<h2>The Traditional Orthography of Japanese</h2>
	
      <p>
	The modern Japanese orthography was standardized in 1946, during the Allied Occupation period after the Second World War. The orthographic reforms of this time rendered modern Japanese spelling phonetic, apart from a handful of vestigial exceptions, and slightly simplified many of the <span lang="ja">漢字</span> in common use in Japan.
      </p>

      <p>
	The traditional orthography, known in Japanese as <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>歴<rb>史<rb>的<rb>仮<rb>名<rb>遣<rp><rt>れき<rt>し<rt>てき<rt>か<rt>な<rt>づかい</rp></ruby></span>, “historical kana usage” or <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>旧<rb>仮<rb>名<rb>遣<rp><rt>きゅう<rt>か<rt>な<rt>づかい</rp></ruby></span>, “old kana usage”, was a system that largely developed in the <span lang="ja">平安時代</span>, and, like modern English orthography, continued to reflect older pronunciations long after they had changed in contemporary speech. Compare for example the English spelling of “knight”, which is pronounced <span class="ipa">/naɪt/</span> in modern English, with the letter sequences “k” and “gh” silent, but was once pronounced something closer to <span class="ipa">/kniçt/</span>, with all consonants sounded. Note also that the vowel has changed from a pure vowel to a diphthong in Modern English.
      </p>

      <h3>The Obsolete w-Row Kana</h3>

      <p>  
	    In the spelling reform of 1946, two kana of the w-row, whose consonants had become silent in modern pronunciation, were completely removed from the modern orthography. These were <span lang="ja">ゐ</span>, <span lang="ja">ヰ</span> <span class="transliteration">wi</span> and <span lang="ja">ゑ</span>, <span lang="ja">ヱ</span> <span class="transliteration">we</span>. In modern Japanese they are entirely replaced by <span lang="ja">い</span>, <span lang="ja">イ</span> <span class="transliteration">i</span> and  <span lang="ja">え</span>, <span lang="ja">エ</span> <span class="transliteration">e</span>, but in the traditional orthography they occur normally in the words they were originally located in, as does <span lang="ja">を</span>, <span lang="ja">ヲ</span> <span class="transliteration">wo</span>, which similarly lost its initial -w and is retained in modern orthography only as the direct object marker.
      <p>

	<h3>The Standardization of Kana and the Distinction of <span class="transliteration">mu</span> and <span class="transliteration">n</span></h3>
      <p>
	It was only in 1900 that the kana system itself was officially standardized in the modern hiragana and katakana forms, including the now obsolete characters for <span class="transliteration">wi</span> and <span class="transliteration">we</span>.

	The hiragana had been derived from cursive simplifications of <span lang="ja">漢字</span>. There are multiple ways to simplify characters, and multiple characters for any given Japanese sound, meaning that before 1900 there existed a great deal of variant kana forms in more or less common use. These non-standard variant forms are known as <span lang="ja"><ruby><rb>変<rb>体<rb>仮<rb>名<rp><rt>へん<rt>たい<rt>が<rt>な</rp></ruby></span>, and are still occasionally seen on store signs and in other decorative contexts.

	In contrast to the variation found in historical hiragana, the standard forms of katakana became regular rather early on, leading to little variation being found in historic katakana usage.
      </p>

      <p>
	The moraic nasal sound, <span class="transliteration">n</span> <span class="ipa">/N/</span>, did not exist in earlier forms of Japanese, and likely developed with the influence of Chinese loanwords. The kana system had already developed when the moraic nasal emerged, and the new sound was written with the same characters as the sound <span class="transliteration">mu</span>, relying on the reader understanding the context to distinguish the two sounds. For this reason the poem <span class="transliteration">Iroha</span>, which used all the sounds of Japanese at the time it was written, and was traditionally used as a kind of Japanese alphabet song, does not contain <span class="transliteration">n</span>. The two sounds were split and assigned separate characters, <span lang="ja">ん</span>, <span lang="ja">ン</span> for <span class="transliteration">n</span> and <span lang="ja">む</span>, <span lang="ja">ム</span> for <span class="transliteration">mu</span>, in the 1900 standardization of kana forms.
