	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE powers of darkness still delay their flight —<br>
	  <span class="indent">Still must we wait to see the morning break;</span><br>
	  But through the long, lone watches of the night<br>
	  <span class="indent">The spirit of the people is awake.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  And there is grave surmise, and haunting fear,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Where lies come haltingly from lips that parch;</span><br>
	  There is no respite now for those who hear<br>
	  <span class="indent">The footbeats of the people on the march.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  There is no sudden foray that is born<br>
	  <span class="indent">Of eager hopes that perish in their prime:</span><br>
	  There is no page of history to be torn<br>
	  <span class="indent">From the vast context of man’s upward climb.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is a part of all we have and are —<a href="#fn1"><sup class="footnote">1</sup></a><br>
	  <span class="indent">Of all we’ve hoped for, and for which we’ve toiled,</span><br>
	  Since the first dreamer saw the gleam afar,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And of his dreams was ruthlessly despoiled.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  These are the days in which men challenge fate<br>
	  <span class="indent">With hard-won knowledge greater than their fears;</span><br>
	  These are the days in which shall culminate<br>
	  <span class="indent">The deathless glory of the long-dead years.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We may not see the golden morning break,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Nor see the powers of darkness take their flight;</span><br>
	  But it is still our privilege to take<br>
	  <span class="indent">A place of honour in the age-old fight.</span>
	</p>
	<p>— Oscar Walters.</p>
