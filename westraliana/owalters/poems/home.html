      <div class="poem">
	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE British Architects discuss,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And seeds of culture proudly sow,</span><br>
	  I see beyond their learned fuss<br>
	  <span class="indent">A house I knew long, long ago.</span><br>
	  No trace of it to-day you’ll find,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And that is well; it would have wrecked</span><br>
	  For evermore, the peace of mind<br>
	  <span class="indent">Of every British Architect.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  ’Twas in the ancient days when flats<br>
	  <span class="indent">And kitchenettes were quite unknown;</span><br>
	  Ere bonnets gave their place to hats,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And ankles were but seldom shown;</span><br>
	  Ere came the paltry side that crabs<br>
	  <span class="indent">And sends the thoughts of men askew,</span><br>
	  Dad felled the trees, and split the slabs,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And set the posts up straight and true.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  He did not work by rule of thumb,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Such method enterprise destroys;</span><br>
	  He took some small advice from Mum,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And some assistance from the boys.</span><br>
	  He knew the job he had to do<br>
	  <span class="indent">And steadfastly he went his way,</span><br>
	  Not knowing of, and unknown to,<br>
	  <span class="indent">The pundits of the R.I.A.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Though he had moments of despair<br>
	  <span class="indent">When difficulties seemed to swell</span><br>
	  The load too large for him to bear,<br>
	  <span class="indent">He had his victories as well.</span><br>
	  For when on winter nights the blaze<br>
	  <span class="indent">Sent out to us its generous heat,</span><br>
	  There was no need of learned praise<br>
	  <span class="indent">To make his recompense complete.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  And we — beneath that roof we grew,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And gave no thought to its design,</span><br>
	  Through all the years we never knew<br>
	  <span class="indent">It lacked a dignity of line.</span><br>
	  And in the days that swiftly came,<br>
	  <span class="indent">How ever far we chanced to roam,</span><br>
	  To us it ever was the same,<br>
	  <span class="indent">A place we simply knew as home.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The world each day more learned grows,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Fresh triumphs man each day achieves</span><br>
	  And he grows wiser, I suppose,<br>
	  <span class="indent">With all the knowledge he receives.</span><br>
	  So it may be the modern lad<br>
	  <span class="indent">Who ponders o’er his weighty tome</span><br>
	  Could build a better house than Dad,<br>
	  <span class="indent">But who could build a better home?</span>
	</p>
