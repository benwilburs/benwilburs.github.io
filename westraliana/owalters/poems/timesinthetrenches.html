	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">D</span>ULL as the days of mid-winter, heavy and languid as time;<br>
	  <span class="indent">Drear is the lot of the sapper, marooned in an ocean of slime,</span><br>
	  Dreaming of days that have vanished, hoping for better to come,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Only to action awakening when the section clerk issues the rum.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Arguments rise in a moment in this muddiest corner of France;<br>
	  <span class="indent">And sappers rush to the conflict with the valor of ignorance,</span><br>
	  Into arguments wild and whirling, into arguments futile and vain<br>
	  <span class="indent">He rushes with wild assertions, and an air of high disdain.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The High Seas Fleet is demolished! and Hughes gets particular hell!<br>
	  <span class="indent">The I Won’t Works are exalted, when Inglis is going well;</span><br>
	  And Murray with ringing curses, impartial and calm as fate<br>
	  <span class="indent">Curses the whole damn outfit, in his evening Hymn of Hate.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Can a template be called a pattern? Is a high wall built or made?<br>
	  <span class="indent">Was Hamlet as mad as a soldier? Should a shovel be called a spade?</span><br>
	  Is Asquith a dinkum statesman? — and should America fight?<br>
	  <span class="indent">Ask of the third field sapper, and he will set you right.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We dream of a good time coming — of beer, and of cleared skies,<br>
	  <span class="indent">When Orchard has left his stiffness, and McGregor won’t dogmatise.</span><br>
	  When we won’t have to duck from the shrapnel, we won’t give a damn for the dud.<br>
	  <span class="indent">Pity the sapper who argues, marooned in an ocean of mud.</span>
	</p>
	<p>— Oscar Walters, late secretary Sandstone Miners, now in France</p>
