      <div class="poem">
	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is one great bond between us that is neither worn nor frayed,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Though He reigns supreme in Heaven and I till the Earth He made;</span><br>
	  Though He is the great Creator — I the smallest, trampled clod,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Yet there is this bond between us — we are weary, I and God.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  By the stern Decree of Eden, I must wring from barren lands<br>
	  <span class="indent">Food for my toil-racked body, whilst He sits with folded hands;</span><br>
	  Low and softly in these ages the celestial choirs do sing.<br>
	  <span class="indent">For a palace sinks to silence when in slumber lies the King.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the primal days of kingship, so the hoary legend says,<br>
	  <span class="indent">He created this vast plaything in six mighty working days;</span><br>
	  Bu the task no doubt distressed Him, and He sought a life of ease;<br>
	  <span class="indent">Now unheeded spins the plaything through the careless centuries.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Now I see the temples totter, and I hear the chanting cease.<br>
	  <span class="indent">When with those first days of vigor we contrast this deathly peace;</span><br>
	  For the prayer remains unanswered and the weak and helpless fall,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And the tyrant goes unhindered whilst His fainting servants call.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  And now, having hurled this pebble, to my glasshouse I’ll retire,<br>
	  <span class="indent">To continue my earth labor and reluctantly perspire;</span><br>
	  And I bid you when I perish carve above this head of mine:<br>
	  <span class="indent">“Yes, he sinned both much and deeply — but his tiredness was divine.”</span>
	</p>
