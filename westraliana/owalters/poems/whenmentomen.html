	  <span class="dropcap">W</span>ELL would it be if Labor Day were Labor Day indeed,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And fellowship was mightier than dogma, race, or creed;</span><br>
	  If there were stronger, straighter words and fewer bending knees,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And none to brazenly aggress, or cravenly appease.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Caught in a web of hate and greed we see the days go by,<br>
	  <span class="indent">With fearful watching for the day when we shall meanly die.</span><br>
	  Nor is there any hope for us while we refuse to give<br>
	  <span class="indent">All that we have to learn to live as men were meant to live.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We talk of solidarity, of brotherhood we speak,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And all the while throughout the world the strong oppress the weak;</span><br>
	  We talk of justice, of peace, and scorn our own pretence<br>
	  <span class="indent">By talking, too, of atom bombs, and atom bomb defence.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Well would it be if Labor Day were Labor Day in fact,<br>
	  <span class="indent">If men in all lands, on all days, as men to men would act.</span><br>
	  We would not be preparing now to go to war again<br>
	  <span class="indent">If all to all would freely give the right to live as men.</span>
