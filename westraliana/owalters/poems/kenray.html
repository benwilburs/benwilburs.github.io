      <h2>#4932 Spr Kenneth Gavan Ray</h2>
      <p>
	<strong>Kenneth Gavan Ray</strong> was a sapper from Hobart who served in the 13<sup>th</sup> Field Company Engineers alongside Oscar Walters. He was killed in action on <time datetime="1916-08-04">August 4<sup>th</sup></time> or <time datetime="1916-08-05">August 5<sup>th</sup> 1916</time>, at the age of 21. He served with his three brothers also in the same company, and though they buried him on the night of his death, in the confusion he was officially declared missing and it was not until mid-1917 that he was confirmed killed in action. His gravesite was lost and has not been identified.
