      <p>Sixty entries were received for the competition for a guinea sonnet on the Federal Capital, and of these at least a dozen were well-wrought and interesting. Exactly half of the sonneteers spoke of Canberra with enthusiastic or modified appreciation, including one whose enthusiasm ran to 16 lines; the other half of the sonneteers sang more in anger than in sorrow.

	  <span class="indent">For eager sonneteers to work upon.</span><br>
	  There is no budding, teeming Babylon<br>
	  <span class="indent">In that weird village by the Cotter’s stream.</span><br>
	  The fulsome speech and psalm dispel our dream;<br>
	  <span class="indent">The city that our hopes were builded on</span><br>
	  Has been to us forbidden, and is gone,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And petty interests mock our fruitless scheme.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  But we, we still must dream, and still we see,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Beyond parochialism's dreary slough</span><br>
	  The shining city we cannot forget.<br>
	  <span class="indent">But, oh, the way is wearying, and we</span><br>
	  Are sorely harassed; I can only know<br>
	  <span class="indent">The time for sonneteering is not yet.</span>
