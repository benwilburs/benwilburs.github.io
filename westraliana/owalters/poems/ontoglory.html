	<p>
	  [By Private Oscar Walters, now on active service in France.]
	</p>

	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">I</span>N the days when the world was younger, in the days when our faith was whole,<br>
	  <span class="indent">We watched with eyes of hunger, the pageant of life unrol.</span><br>
	  We knelt at the shrine of beauty — our homage we gave to truth.<br>
	  <span class="indent">We were Lords, for a moment only, in the wonderful court of youth.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  And in our world, dimming our joyous song,<br>
	  <span class="indent">The War God awoke from his slumber, and smote on his burnished gong.</span><br>
	  And the days of our freedom vanished, our world in pieces was rent.<br>
	  <span class="indent">The War God called us to battle, and the youth to the slaughter went.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We have followed him where he has led us, we have needed his high commands,<br>
	  <span class="indent">With fear in our hearts and anguish, and death in our weary hands.</span><br>
	  We have slaved in the sands of the desert — we have toiled in the dustand the heat.<br>
	  <span class="indent">We have followed the path of glory, through the snow, and the mud, and the sleet.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We have fought in the fiercest of battles since ever the world began.<br>
	  <span class="indent">We have rotted in mud in the trenches, for of such is the madness of man.</span><br>
	  We are weary of horror and travail — of death — and we would forget,<br>
	  <span class="indent">But the guns still flash in the darkness, and the War God calls us yet.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the days when the world was younger, in the days when our faith was whole,<br>
	  <span class="indent">We watched with eyes of hunger, the pageant of life unrol.</span><br>
	  We knelt at the shrine of beauty; and while we were bowing the knee,<br>
	  <span class="indent">We were sold to the god of battles — to anguish and misery!</span>
