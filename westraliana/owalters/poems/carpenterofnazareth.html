	  <span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN men bow down to hate and greed, and say, <q class="verbatim">“Thy will be done”</q>;<br>
	  <span class="indent">When might usurps the place of right, my thoughts return to One:</span><br>
	  A simple Carpenter who came from far-off Nazareth<br>
	  <span class="indent">To bring new life into the world — the world that gave Him death.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  When lies are fitted out with wings, while truth must slowly plod;<br>
	  <span class="indent">When profiteers their voices raise in thanks unto their gods;</span><br>
	  I think of One who found for us the secret and the key<br>
	  <span class="indent">Among the lowly fishermen of ancient Galilee.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  He did not dwell with those who had rich stores of corn and oil;<br>
	  <span class="indent">He knew the grim companionship of hunger and of toil;</span><br>
	  He scorned the senseless arrogance of empty wealth and race,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And strove to build a world where greed would find no resting place.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  He won the hatred of the rich, and those, to their dismay,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Whose smug self-righteousness He drew into the light of day.</span><br>
	  And so they slew this Man who mocked their mean, age-sanctioned plan<br>
	  <span class="indent">By preaching up and down the land the brotherhood of man.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  He saw the tyrant go unchecked; He saw men cringe and crawl,<br>
	  <span class="indent">He preached a large humanity to those whose hearts were small.</span><br>
	  Betrayed by those He came to save, He suffered and He died,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And after twenty centuries He still is crucified.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  For we bow down to hate and greed, and still, to His distress,<br>
	  <span class="indent">We hide our sins beneath a cloak of smug self-righteousness.</span><br>
	  But once in every year, at least, lip-service we give<br>
	  <span class="indent">To One who came from Nazareth to teach us how to live.</span>
