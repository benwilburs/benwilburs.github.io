	Sapper Oscar Walters, who was secretary of the Sandstone Branch of the A.W.A., enlisted from there and is now “somewhere at the front,” recently received a letter from his mother, in which she wrote: <q>Alan dreamt last night that he was at the war with you. He was your little mate.</q>
      </p>
      <p>In one of his letters Oscar writes:</p>
      <div class="poem">
	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">
	    I</span>T was for a short time only that all of our schemes seemed wrecked,<br>
	  <span class="indent">That we had forsaken our dearest to earn a foe’s respect.</span><br>
	And dully we watched the sun set in a world of blood and hate,<br>
	  <span class="indent">When in our blunted senses stole the dream of a Little Mate.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  And they who were faint and weary in the long, grim fight with pain<br>
	  <span class="indent">Smiled at your fanciful dreaming, and smiling, took heart again</span><br>
	  <q class="verbatim">“Dear Little Mate, do you blame us if we, when the fight was hot,<br>
	    <span class="indent">Slaughtered and gazed at the slaughter, and slaughtering, forgot?”</q></span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  No longer with feet uncertain we travel a path unknown;<br>
	  <span class="indent">Fearless we face a morrow we dared not face alone.</span><br>
	  Out on the lone, grim places ever on guard we stand,<br>
	  <span class="indent">That your dreaming be unmolested — that your dreams be large and grand.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  For you fight with us in the trenches, you walk with us in the snows,<br>
	  <span class="indent">You go with us on the long fatigues that only a soldier knows.</span><br>
	  When we fight for you in the darkness, in the darkness you fight with us<br>
	  <span class="indent">In the hell that we have created; the gods have ordained it thus.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We have little of goodness and wisdom, we pawns in the hands of Fate.<br>
	  <span class="indent">We have sinned as man can only, yet each has a Little Mate</span><br>
	  Who gives him the greater courage in the game of the desperate chance,<br>
	  <span class="indent">’Tis the Little Mates who will lead us on in the days of the great advance.</span>
