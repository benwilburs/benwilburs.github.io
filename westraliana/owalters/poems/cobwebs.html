	  <span class="dropcap">C</span>OBWEBS were a great invention only twelve short months ago,<br>
	  <span class="indent">But the best — and worst — intention can become a source of woe.</span><br>
	  And to-day poor Ross McLarty knows that he’s been sold a pup,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And is sorry that his party ever put the damned things up.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  While the folk whose votes they wrangled are inquiring, <q class="verbatim">“What the heck?”</q><br>
	  <span class="indent">Ross and Co. are badly tangled in a cobweb bottleneck.</span><br>
	  They who promised speedy action in all matters, everywhere,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Plus the utmost satisfaction, now have cobwebs in their hair.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  As Ross swings his duster bravely, Watts is lost in dust and doubt,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Cardell-Oliver says gravely, <q class="verbatim">“We will never get them out.”</q></span><br>
	  Parker sneezes, good old Nosey, Ross McDonald looks forlorn,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Seward picks a cobweb posy from a cobweb-festooned Thorn.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Doney doesn’t feel so able, Abbott doesn’t feel so good,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Peering ’neath a cobwebbed table where they last had sight of Wood.</span><br>
	  So they struggle, so they bicker, as their first year o’er them rolls,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And the cobwebs grow still thicker, even in the pigeon-holes.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Cobwebs seemed a great invention when the voting went their way,<br>
	  <span class="indent">But they hate the very mention of the goddam things to-day.</span><br>
	  Busy now with mop and duster, with their work not yet begun,<br>
	  <span class="indent">They can only rave and bluster, caught in cobwebs that they spun.</span>
	</p>

      <p>One of the Liberal Party's campaign slogans in 1947 was sweeping the Labor ‘cobwebs’ away; Labor had been in power in Western Australia for fourteen years at that point. The Coalition won the election, but were embarassed by the infighting that plagued their new government.</p>
