	<p>
	  <span class="dropcap">D</span>O you remember on Shrapnel Green,<br>
	  <span class="indent">On that far-off bitter November day,</span><br>
	  When the snow lay thick, and the wind blew keen,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And the blanketed dead in a long row lay,</span><br>
	  When your gaze went over the tideless sea<br>
	  <span class="indent">Where rode the monitors grey and grim,</span><br>
	  The words you said when you turned to me<br>
	  <span class="indent">With voice grown husky, and eyes grown dim?</span><br>
	  You watched for a moment a ’plane’s swift climb,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And you said, as a great gun belched its flame:</span><br>
	  <q class="verbatim">“Surely to God there will be a time<br>
	   <span class="indent">When men won't come at this devilish game!”</span></q>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Have you forgotten the words you spoke<br>
	  <span class="indent">When the dead in their blankets lay very still,</span><br>
	  The words you said in a voice that broke,<br>
	  <span class="indent">With a monitor searching for Beachy Bill,</span><br>
	  And Imbros rising across the sea<br>
	  <span class="indent">And a fast ’plane sliding across the sky —</span><br>
	  To the left a rattle of musketry,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And we poor fools in a world awry,</span><br>
	  Pausing awhile in our bitter task<br>
	  <span class="indent">To wonder vainly what it could mean?</span><br>
	  Have you forgotten, old mate, I ask<br>
	  <span class="indent">The prayer you uttered on Shrapnel Green?</span>
	</p>
      
	<p>
	  Did you catch a gleam from a vanished age?<br>
	  <span class="indent">Did you hear an echo from other years?</span><br>
	  Did you catch a murmur of ancient rage<br>
	  <span class="indent">And see sad eyes that were dim with tears?</span><br>
	  Did you see men fight for an ancient wrong<br>
	  <span class="indent">As men would fight in the years to come?</span><br>
	  Did you see the galleys and hear the song<br>
	  <span class="indent">Of victors homing from Ilium?</span><br>
	  What had you seen when you turned to me?<br>
	  <span class="indent">Whence came the prayer that I heard you say</span><br>
	  When your gaze went over the old, old sea<br>
	  <span class="indent">On that far-off bitter November day?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	  To Shrapnel Green there has come once more<br>
	  <span class="indent">The quiet dreams that the great guns broke;</span><br>
	  Men have returned to the days of yore.<br>
	  <span class="indent">But one remembers the words you spoke</span><br>
	  With a monitor shelling along the right,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And shrapnel bursting above Lone Pine,</span><br>
	  And the shell-torn Green ’neath its pall of white,<br>
	  <span class="indent">And the blanketed dead in a long still line.</span><br>
	  I know not whither your path has led,<br>
	  <span class="indent">Your name’s forgotten, but this I know:</span><br>
	  The world has need of the prayer you said<br>
	  <span class="indent">On Shrapnel Green in the long ago.</span><br>
	</p>
