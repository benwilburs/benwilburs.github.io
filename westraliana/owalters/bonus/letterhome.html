	Private O Walters, of Sandstone, writes the following interesting letter to Mr. T Rochester, Cue. The letter is dated Egypt,<time datetime="1915-09-28"> Sept 28</time>: —
      </p>
      <blockquote>We arrived here on Sunday night, Egypt seems to be mostly dust. We are camped at Zeitoum, about eight miles from Cairo. I have not seen Cairo or the Pyramids yet, but have been to Zeitoum and Heliopolis. Good beer seems to be almost unprocurable. Egyptian beer is awful muck. The money here is a bit confusing — the piastre, called by the Australians “disaster,” is the standard coin, and is worth 2½d. Discipline is very strict here. Some of our chaps were absent from parade yesterday afternoon, and have got 21 days gaol; they also lose 50 days pay. There is a kind of Cleopatras Needle here, alleged to have been erected by Moses, it is about 50ft high and about 6ft square at the base. The stone is granite, and I don’t know where Moses got it from for I haven’t seen any similar rock about. Another chap and I had an exciting race on donkeys last night, I won pretty easily owing to him colliding with a native cab. Some of the streets in Zeitoum are about 6ft wide, and hum like bone mills; but there are some splendid buildings here and at Heliopolis. The weather is pretty good, not too warm, and as we do our drill in about 12in of dust it is just as well. There are splendid roads running to Cairo. We came up along side the Canal from Suez for a long way, there is a good deal of cultivation; but most of the journey was in the dark, so we could not see too much.

      <blockquote>
	I have not received any letters from home yet, though a mail from Australia arrived to-day. I am keeping well and fit – they keep us busy here. I have seen Cairo, also the Pyramids. Cairo is an awful place – the native quarter is absolutely vile. On Sunday afternoon we walked for hours down streets from 4 to 10ft wide. All the work of the place is done in shops on each side of the streets — bakers, blacksmiths, and other shops — also poultry dealers where they pluck fowls alive. It is horrible to hear the fowls squawking while their feathers are being plucked. Child labor is the prevailing custom — poor little devils, 5 and 6 years old working for their lives. The Nile is a muddy disappointment, not nearly as wide as I thought it would be. On Sunday Latlean and I went to the Pyramids, we didn’t have much time to spare, so did not stop as long as I would have liked. The face of the Sphinx is in much better order than I thought it was, only the nose is missing. Those two palm trees you see in pictures of the Sphinx and Pyramids are not there, though there are plenty of Palms about a quarter mile away. We went into the Pyramids of Cheops, it is mostly winzes and rises; you start down a winze, a guide having hold of each hand, and slide about 50ft, then go along about 100ft to the King’s chamber, and up about 100ft to the Queen’s chamber. It was awfully hot in there, and there was nothing much more to see than there is in Hack’s mine. The Temple of (Chefreh), who build the second Pyramid, is near the Sphinx, there are enormous blocks of granite in it. The Pyramids look best at about two miles distant; near at hand the clamour of guides, donkey and camel men almost drive you mad. The two guides who held my hands demanded five piastres each. I gave them one each, and then another brigand demanded a piastre for pushing behind which he did not get. We did not have time to go up the Pyramids. We are expecting to go to Lemnos any day now. It is very hot here in the middle of the day and rather cold at night. Dust is our chief trouble, and we have about two shower baths a day. We get absolutely no news of the war. The Egyptian papers, ‘tis said, not being allowed to publish any news of the Dardanelles, and certainly they do not. We have had a march through the desert to-day with full packs up — it is strenuous work ploughing through the dust. Remember me to all.
