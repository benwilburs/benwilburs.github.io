	<h2>The Life of Oscar Walters</h2>
      <p>
	<strong>Oscar Walters</strong>, born in 1889 in Queenstown, Victoria, was a veteran of the First World War and longtime editor of the Australian Labor Party's Western Australian newspaper, the <em> Westralian Worker</em>. In addition, he was a prolific and noted poet, whose poems were regularly published in the <em>Worker</em> and nationally in <em>The Bulletin</em> from the 1900s through to his death in 1948. Although now largely obscure, he was quite popular in his own lifetime, with one S. Lee Collins of Queensland writing in 1942 that <q>Thousands of men have Oscar Walters’s verse cut out and put away, and they haven’t worried to do that with any other since Lawson and Paterson</q>, and Captain C. R. Collins giving multiple public lectures on ‘Oscar Walters – the man and his verse’ in 1943. In 1931 the Perth branch of the Returned Services League issued a collection of his war poetry entitled <em>Shrapnel Green and other verses</em>, which was popular enough to receive a second edition. The titular poem of the collection recounts his remembrances of Gallipoli, and the other poems deal with his wartime experiences in France and elsewhere. In addition to his war verses, Walters was a frequent publisher of topical political verse, with a biting satirical slant. He was a longtime stalwart of the Western Australian labour movement, and when he died of a sudden heart attack, shortly after leaving the <em>Worker</em> offices, his funeral was well attended. His brothers Charles and Harold, who predeceased him and are interred in the same grave along with their mother Robina, were also labour activists, and Charles an essayist who wrote often on political topics of the day; one of Charles’ essays won a monetary prize from The West Australian.

	The youngest child of Laurence Albert Walters and Robina Sarah Walters (née Joyce), Oscar’s father died the same year that he was born. Oscar moved with his mother Robina and his brothers Charles (‘Charlie’) and Harold to the Goldfields of Western Australia in 1907, leaving a married sister, Cecilia Sier, behind in Victoria. In 1908, answering a call for national poets, he had a ‘good stanza’  picked for publication on <em>The Bulletin</em>’s famous ‘Red Page’, and in 1909 he had his first full poem published in that magazine. A few more poems followed over the next few years, including one submitted on the occasion of the foundation of Canberra, while the eve of the war found Walters the Secretary of the Sandstone Miners’ Union, marking the beginning of his labour activism. In 1915, he was a defendant in a civil case against the Youanmi and Sandstone Miners’ Unions brought by a group of mining contractors claiming unlawful conspiracy to prevent them from mining in the district, in which the judge found in favour of the plaintiffs and awarded damages.

	Shortly thereafter, he enlisted in the Australian Expeditionary Force at Blackboy Hill, Western Australia (Service No.: 2685), and went to Gallipoli with the 11th Australian Infantry Battalion, before being transferred to the 3rd Field Company Engineers in late 1915. He was sent to France and was wounded twice in 1917, on the second occasion being sent to England to recuperate from a gunshot wound to the leg.

	After the war, Walters returned to the Goldfields, where he resumed mining work with his brothers. Having sent several poems home from the front during the war years, such as ‘Our Little Mates’, he began submitting poems for the <em>Westralian Worker</em> from Jasper Hill via Cue. When the mining venture at Jasper Hill failed, the family briefly tried their hand at independent prospecting, before moving to Perth on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1924. Oscar joined the <em>Worker</em> staff, at the time under the editorship of future Prime Minister John Curtin, who was reputed to hold Walters in high regard as one of the finest labour writers in Australia. In 1928, a section dedicated entirely to Walters’ poetry was published in the paper. His verse was collected in the R.S.L. edition <em>Shrapnel Green and other verses</em> in 1931, and then anthologized in the influential Western Australian compilation <em>Jarrah Leaves</em> in 1933. It was around this time that he headed back to the Goldfields as manager of the Peoples’ Printing and Publishing Company office in Kalgoorlie, before again returning to Perth in 1938 to take up editorship of the <em>Westralian Worker</em>, upon the death of Dave Watson.

	It was during his time in the Goldfields that Walters became an early critic of the growing influence of Soviet-style communism in the labour movement; his anti-communist stance led to frequent personal attacks on him in the Communist Party of Australia’s Western Australian newspapers, <em>The Red Star</em> and <em>The Workers' Star</em>. The <em> Westralian Worker</em> was sued, unsuccessfully, in a high profile libel case under his editorship in 1941, by one June Carder, whose organization the Budget Protest Committee was alleged by the Worker to be a Communist front organization.

	On the outbreak of the Second World War, in 1939, Walters’ verse was again anthologized in the book <em>Carry On!</em>. In 1941, as its secretary, he oversaw the establishment of the Labor radio station 6KY in Perth, and continued throughout the 1940s as editor of the <em>Westralian Worker</em>. After several weeks of poor health, he sent the paper to press one Wednesday afternoon in 1948, and collapsed in the street half an hour later. An ambulance was called, but Walters was dead on arrival to hospital. His funeral at Karrakatta had a large attendance. Three years later, the <em>Westralian Worker</em> itself ceased publication, citing newsprint shortages and other difficulties. Oscar Walters was survived by his widow, Emmie Elizabeth, who died in 1990 at the age of 91.

      <p>
	Some of Walters’s most notable poems include ‘Shrapnel Green’, ‘A Road in France’, and ‘The Drink Before You Go’, ‘One Sunday Mornin’ on Gallipoli’, and ‘Dan’, all published and illustrated in <em>The Bulletin</em>.
