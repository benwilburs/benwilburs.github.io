  <p>This is my personal website. It is currently <em>under construction</em>,
    but I intend to fill it out with various content related to my interests and activities.</p>

  <p>In the <strong>Languages</strong> section, you will find some information about various languages I have studied over the years, in particular I intend to fill out the subsections on <strong>Classical Chinese</strong> and <strong>Classical Japanese</strong>, two languages I am currently trying to learn.</p>

  <p>Under <strong>Westraliana</strong>, you may find various things about my home state of Western Australia. I am currently working on a project to collect the poems of <strong>Oscar Walters (1889-1948)</strong>, a WWI war poet and labour activist whose poetry was once a regular feature of such publications as the <em>Westralian Worker</em> and <em>The Bulletin</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Photos</strong> will take you to a gallery of some of the photos I have taken over the years. The better ones, at least.</p>

  <p>To contact me, see the details on my <strong><a href="contact.html">Contact
    </a></strong> page.</p>
